This part, -p 8082:8082, maps the container's internal port 8082 to your host machine's port 8082. The application inside the container is listening for HTTP traffic on port 8082.

You mentioned you are trying to access it at: https://<host>8086/dotAdmin

This URL is incorrect for two reasons:

    The Port: You are trying to use port 8086, but your script maps the application to port 8082.

    The Protocol: You are using https://, which is for secure connections. The port 8082 is configured for standard, unencrypted http.

The Solution: Use the Correct URL

Based on your script, the correct URL to access the dotCMS admin panel is:

http://<your_host_ip_or_localhost>:8082/dotAdmin

    Protocol: http

    Port: 8082

    Path: /dotAdmin
